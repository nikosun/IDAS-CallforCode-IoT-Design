- [**IDAS - Call for Code - IoT Design**](https://github.com/nikosun/IDAS-CallforCode-IoT-Design/) (This repositry, IoT/Hardware)

**Note:** In the index page, [**The Block Diagram illustration**](https://github.com/nikosun/IDAS-CallforCode/blob/master/README.md#block-diagram-simplified) is described by generic words for clear and easy understanding, however each branch repository is in technical terms and codes.

## Task Lists to do

### Hardware - Frame body design
#### Sensor Node (= Child Unit)
- [x] Prototyping for function (as shown on presentation video)
- [ ] **LoRaWAN** field test (It would be tested outside Japan/TELEC)

#### LoRa/LoRaWAN
- [ ] **LoRaWAN** connection test with Arm/Pelion and TTN(The Things Network)
- [ ] **LoRaWAN** field test (It may outside )

#### Anemometer
- [x] Sensor node(=Child Unit) body beta design
- [x] **Anemometer** body prototyping - Carbon fiber, rotation type
- [ ] **Anemometer** body prototyping - 3D CAD re-design for production, rotation type

Up to 10 miles / 15 km range
